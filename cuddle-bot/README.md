# cuddle-bot
This is a personal project, so contributions will generally be ignored.

This is a general purpose home server golang service. It will be a somewhat interactive Discord bot with a Golang backend that may call some Rust and C++ utilities behind the scenes.
It will also include some development script and tools focused on contrived CI/CD to a Docker host on my network.
